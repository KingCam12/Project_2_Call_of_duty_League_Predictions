# **Team Matchup Prediction Tool**

## **Overview**
The **Team Matchup Prediction Tool** predicts the outcome of Call of Duty League matchups based on team stats, such as **Overall KD**, **Search Destroy KD**, **Control KD**, and **Hardpoint KD**. This interactive tool lets users input two teams, compare their performance metrics, and calculate the likelihood of each team winning.
### Project Overview
The Team Matchup Prediction Tool is designed to provide data-driven insights into match outcomes in the Call of Duty League (CDL). 
By leveraging advanced machine learning models, the tool predicts the
likelihood of a team winning based on key performance metrics, including:
Overall KD, Search Destroy KD, Control KD, Hardpoint KD
### Why Predictions Matter
Sports Betting:
Accurate predictions are critical for bettors looking to make informed decisions. 
Traditional sports betting markets are increasingly incorporating eSports, and CDL predictions provide a competitive edge.
By analyzing team performance data, this tool helps bettors identify favorable odds and reduce the risks of their wagers.

## **Features**
- Predicts the winner of a matchup based on trained machine learning models.
- Provides **win probabilities** for each KD category:
  - Overall KD
  - Search Destroy KD
  - Control KD
  - Hardpoint KD
- Interactive interface for easy team selection.
- Supports multiple comparisons in a single session.

## **Requirements**
To run the project, you need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- The following Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `joblib`
  - `scikit-learn`

---

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   cd team-matchup-prediction-tool
---

# Example Usage
```
Welcome to the Team Matchup Prediction Tool!

Available Teams:
1. ATL FaZe
2. Optic Texas
3. LA Thieves
4. VAN Surge

Enter the number for Team A: 1
Enter the number for Team B: 2

--- Matchup Prediction Results ---
Team A: ATL FaZe
Team B: Optic Texas
Predicted Winner: Team A

Category Win Probabilities:
  Overall KD: 65.32% chance Team A wins
  Search Destroy KD: 65.32% chance Team A wins
  Control KD: 65.32% chance Team A wins
  Hardpoint KD: 65.32% chance Team A wins

Would you like to compare another matchup? (yes/no): no
Thank you for using the prediction tool. Goodbye!

# Training the Model
If you want to retrain the model:

Use the real_game_data.csv dataset or your own matchups data.
Train the model using a Random Forest or Logistic Regression:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from joblib import dump

### Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

### Save the model
dump(model, 'model_combined.pkl')
